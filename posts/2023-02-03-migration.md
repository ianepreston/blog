# Update

This blog is now rendered with [quarto](https://quarto.org/) rather than [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages). Honestly fastpages was working fine for me, but they've deprecated it
and I like being on the new thing. There are some nice navigation and filtering features
added in this new tool, and the live preview on my dev machine works quite nicely.
Mostly I'm making this post to ensure that my github action was set up correctly.
