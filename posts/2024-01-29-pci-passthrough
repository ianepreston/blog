# Introduction

I'm using some mini PCs as my XCP-NG hosts and I want to pass their integrated Intel
graphics through to a VM so I can use it for transcoding. Wish me luck!

# Reference material

[The official docs](https://docs.xcp-ng.org/compute/#pci-passthrough)
[A blog where someone else got it working](https://jasonloong.com/blog/migrated-a-plex-intel-nuc-to-xcp-ng-xenserver-with-igpu-passthrough)
[A forum post where they got it working from the GUI but not CLI](https://xcp-ng.org/forum/topic/6211/intel-gpu-passthrough-question/4?_=1662834738963)
