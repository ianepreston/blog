# Introduction

I have enjoyed learning proxmox, and haven't run into any deal breakers with it, but I
also like to see if the grass is greener. After watching some videos from
[Tom at Lawrence Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB22GKGJkHY) I decided
xcp-ng might be more to my liking. This post will document what I did to get it set up
and my thoughts on using it.

# Initial installation experience

I did not get off to the best start, as shortly after booting the most recent stable
release (8.2 at the time of this writing) I found myself looking at a blank screen
and unable to proceed. After a bit of searching I found [this post](https://forums.lawrencesystems.com/t/xcp-ng-installer-fails-to-run/15197)
which led me to try the 8.3 beta release, which fixed my issue. I can see how that sort
of thing would scare someone off, but I decided to press on. With the 8.3 installer I
was able to get through the install process, which was quite straightforward. One thing
I liked off the hop vs Proxmox was the option to use DHCP rather than static IPs. I prefer
to handle IP assignment in pfsense with static leases, as that makes it easier to associate
hosts with a DNS entry, persists IPs across reinstalls, and makes all my address information
centrally accessible.

# First experience

Once the machine booted up I was in a pretty basic looking [TUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface).
In some ways that's nicer than proxmox, which just drops you into a root prompt with a
note to go to the web UI. It did allow some basic admin and provided system info. I didn't
really try to do any of the admin from the terminal, since I know that's not the approach
I really want to take. I know ultimately I'm going to want [Xen Orchestra](https://xen-orchestra.com/#!/xo-home)
but just for kicks I decided to open up the IP of my machine in a browser.
This brought me to a [XO-lite](https://xen-orchestra.com/blog/xen-orchestra-lite/) page.
It looked sharp, but after a bit of digging around almost all of the functionality 
just took me to an "Under Construction" page. I assume this is something to do with me
running a beta version of XCP-NG. Now I find myself in a bit of a chicken and egg situation.
To really configure XCP-NG I want to host a Xen Orchestra server somewhere. The optimal
place for it is a VM on XCP-NG, but I can't figure out how to install VMs without Xen-Orchestra.

It looks like I can launch a docker container of XO, so let's try that until I can bootstrap
a proper server. Obviously not a reliable long term solution, but I grabbed the
compose spec from [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/ronivay/xen-orchestra) and spun it up
on my workstation. That loaded pretty easily and from there I was able to log in with the
default credentials the container creates and add a host. Initially there was an issue
adding the host but after I allowed it to use a self-signed cert the connection went
smoothly.

# Adding a VM

Getting meta again, let's try loading a debian VM that I can load XO onto. Eventually
if I decide to stick with this I'll rebuild it with templates and other fun stuff but
for now we're mostly just testing out the system. The first thing I have to do is get
a Debian ISO (most of the guides seem to do XO on Debian and I'm comfortable with
that distro so why not?) onto the system. Per [the docs](https://xcp-ng.org/docs/storage.html#storage-types)
I first need to create an ISO SR (Storage Repository). Eventually I'll want this to be
an NFS share on my NAS, but while I'm just messing around let's do a local one. I have
to create a path on the local storage to contain the ISOs, and as near as I can tell
there's no way to do that from the XO UI. So I ssh into the host and `mkdir /isos`. 
Not the most creative name, but whatever. Back at the XO UI I hit "New" on the sidebar,
then storage and fill in a local ISO storage setup for the directory I just made (it won't
auto create the directory if it doesn't exist, I checked). Having created this SR now I
have to get an ISO into it. It's not super intuitive how to do that, but following
[this post](https://xcp-ng.org/blog/2022/05/05/how-to-create-a-local-iso-repository-in-xcp-ng/)
I got it figured out. It does let me load ISOs directly from a URL which saves me downloading
to my workstation only to immediately upload to XO, so that's nice.

With that I think I'm ready to add a VM. On the sidebar I click "New" and then "VM".
I choose Debian 12 as my template (this isn't a full VM template, it just auto populates
some settings). I give it 4 cores, the max this machine has, and 4GB of RAM, which is the
minimum advised to run XO. I pick the ISO from the SR I just created for the boot medium.
For network interfaces I put it on the pool wide network, at some point in the future I'll
mess around with different network interfaces too, but this is fine for now.

Ahh, oops, I've hit another snag. I haven't created a SR for disks. I think I could just
make another folder like I did for the ISO, but this is seeming like an increasingly bad
idea. From the terminal in the host I can see it's made a root partition on my internal NVME
drive of 18GB for XCP-NG itself, plus another few small ones like a 4GB logs partition.
This leaves me with a 435GB unmounted partition on my NVME drive, plus my SSD. What's the
appropriate way to use the rest of this NVME storage for VMs? From looking at the docs
it seems like I can just specify a partition and it will set it up for me. From running
`lsblk` on the host when I was figuring out my storage availability I know the partition
name. Let's try it. Ok, I got an error.

## Figuring out how to add VM storage

The error that I see in the log is `SR_BACKEND_FAILURE_77(, Logical Volume group creation failed, )`
The first result takes me to a [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/XenServer/comments/d1nd4c/xcpng_sr_backend_failure_77/)
that suggests this is an issue because I'd previously used this drive for zfs, which I
had when it was running proxmox. Again from the terminal and following [this guide](https://linuxconfig.org/wipefs-linux-command-tutorial-with-examples) `wipefs /dev/nvme0n1*` does return some
`zfs_member` tags.

After a little messing around I did a couple runs of `wipefs -o <offset of ZFS tag> /dev/<device or partition of device> -f`
to get rid of the tags, I ran the command with the `-n` flag first to make sure it was
removing the right tag.

After doing that I got the same error. There's either more tags I need to remove (the original post
just dropped everything, I tried to be more surgical), or I need a reboot. Let's try
the reboot first. Reboot didn't fix it. Let's try the full wipe on both the device and its
partitions. If that breaks something I'll do a reinstall anyway, not like I've put much on
this box at this point. That worked! `wipefs -a -f /dev/nvme0n1` and `wipefs -a -f /dev/nvme01p3`
allowed me to create a SR for VM images. Well on my way now. **DON'T ACTUALLY JUST DO THIS, SEE BELOW**

## Back to adding a VM

The rest of the setup is pretty straightforward. I'm able to give the VM a disk in
the storage location. There's a bunch of advanced features that I'm skipping for now,
but will definitely have to come back to at some point for future builds.

After that the machine auto started and I was able to walk through the graphical installer
from the "Console" tab on the VM. I saw some things in the docs about setting up VNC
for a better full screen experience, but that's definitely a step for a later date as well.

The installation completed and at the end I had a running Debian install.

## Have to reinstall

After I got the Debian VM set up I figured this was a good time to update the XCP-NG host
to a static lease and give it a reboot. Unfortunately in doing that I discovered that
my `wipefs` exploits had removed the boot flags from my drive as well. I'm sure there would
be some clever way to carefully stitch those labels back on but I really don't feel like
it. Reinstall XCP-NG, add it back to the XO that's still running in a container on my
workstation. Interestingly my local VM storage repository showed up on a fresh install,
albeit without any disks. Maybe that's how it's supposed to work by default if you don't
have any flags on your extra partition that blocks it. I recreate the ISO SR but just put
it in `/media/` this time since that's what the docs suggest and I don't have to create
a new folder. Still have to make some shared folders on my NAS to support this better
eventually. I really don't like how you add ISOs. I want to be able to add it from the
SR page but instead I have to go to "Import" on the sidebar. I'm sure I'll figure that out
eventually but right now I find it quite unintuitive. After getting that going it's
relatively quick to get the VM reinstalled. Let's try this again.

## Management tools

Maybe not the obvious place to start, but I really like it when VM info is integrated
into my UI. Looking at this machine I see "Management agent not detected". For Ubuntu
according to [the docs](https://xcp-ng.org/docs/guests.html#linux) I'd install
`xe-guest-utilities`, but I can't find that in debian. Looking a little further down
the docs I see how to mount and install from the guest utilities ISO that comes with
my setup. That seems to work fine. After a reboot I can see all my information.

## Paste to console

As little as I'm planning to use the virtual console in the web ui, I really do want
to figure out how to paste into it. `ctrl+c`, `ctrl+shift+ins` etc do not seem to be working,
nor is just right clicking for paste. From [this post](https://xcp-ng.org/forum/topic/5538/please-add-a-paste-option-into-the-console-in-xoa)
it's not likely to be fixed in this version. From a look at the roadmap it's in development (XO 6 that is)
but I don't see a release date and there's nothing available for preview. I'll stick with
it for now. I think that was also the case for dark mode.

# Xen Orchestra in an actual VM

From the guides I've seen, the best way to do this is run the script in [this repo](https://github.com/ronivay/XenOrchestraInstallerUpdater).
As discussed in the previous section, I can't paste that URL into the web console.
By default I can only ssh into this VM as my user account (root is disabled) and sudo
isn't installed, which is a bummer. From [the debian wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/sudo)
it looks like their preferred pattern is to run `su --login` to become root. I guess
that's fine too. At least I can paste into my terminal now that I'm not just in the
web console.

Following the instructions: I clone the repository, copy the `sample.xo-install.cfg` to
`xo-install.cfg`, realize I don't have `vim` installed, install `vim` and then edit my
newly copied config. Reading through it I don't see anything I want to change. There's
some stuff for certificate generation that I might want to deal with at some point, but
not right now. By default it seems to install all possible plugins, I don't see why I'd
want to limit myself right now. Let's give this a go. The script ran for a bit, but failed
somewhere around the build/install step. The output points me to a log file so let's see
if I can figure out what went wrong.

## Check the log file for issues

Checking the logs it looks like a URL issue:

```bash
An unexpected error occurred: "https://registry.yarnpkg.com/css-parse/-/css-parse-2.0.0.tgz: Request failed \"502 Bad Gateway\
```

I seem to be able to download that fine from my workstation, I wonder if it was just
an intermittent failure? Let's give it one more run before we get too heavy into
troubleshooting:

```bash
WARNING: free disk space in /opt seems to be less than 1GB. Install/update will most likely fail
```

Did I just not make a big enough virtual disk for this? Let's take a look. Oh yeah,
root is almost entirely full. I didn't really look at the default partition sizing
but it gave almost all the disk to `/home` and left basically nothing. Do I want to resize
or just reinstall? From a bit of reading I can't resize active volumes, so I guess we're
doing a reinstall. What a fun learning experience! This is why I like having OS templates
and automation for everything.

## Have to reinstall

At least I have the presence of mind to manually give this new VM the same MAC as my old
one so the static lease for it will persist. I'm only going to give it 10GB this time,
but I'm going to be a lot more sensible about my allocation of storage, basically just
one giant partition. After the reinstall I mount the guest utils ISO, reinstall guest
utils and reboot. Reinstall `git` and `vim`. Clone the repo, copy over the template file,
don't bother editing it since I didn't have to last time. Run the installer. This time it
worked, must have just been a disk space problem last time.

## Test it out

After a reboot I head to the address of my VM and there it is! I have to re-add my
host but that works easily enough and now I can see my VM that's running the orchestration
server I'm looking at it through. How meta.

# Figure out how to move this machine back to my rack

I've had this node sitting on my desk while I set it up, but now I want it back in my
rack. I don't think I can tell XO to shut down the host until the VMs running it are off,
but one of the VMs running on it is XO. Good thing I still have that container version
up I guess. From the container XO I shut down the VM XO and then the host. After moving
it down to my rack I'm able to wake it with WOL from my router (I could have just hit the
button but wanted to make sure I still had that working). From the container XO I see the
host come back up, but the VM doesn't. Looking at the settings I didn't have it set to
auto start. Update the settings to auto power on, but it looks like that maybe only applies
when the host itself restarts, manually start it for now. Ok, I'm back up and running XO
from my VM on my XCP-NG box!

# Add a couple more hosts

One hypervisor is cool, but a lot of what I'm going to want to test is going to require
at least one more host. Given that I have 3 machines set aside for dev, and I just broke
the proxmox cluster that was running on the other two by installing XCP-NG on this
host without removing it from the cluster I might as well set up 3 nodes.
