# Introduction

While messing around with setting up storage I learned a couple
other neat things about setting up my cluster that don't
really fit elsewhere, but I don't want to lose them.

Both of these tips come from checking out
[kevindurb's repo](https://github.com/kevindurb/k8s) so big
shoutout to him.

# Patches for talconfig

In all the docs and other repos I'd seen before this point patches
were added as strings inside the talhelper config. So I had
sections looking like this:

```yaml
patches:
  - |-
    cluster:
      apiServer:
        admissionControl:
          - name: PodSecurity
            configuration:
              apiVersion: pod-security.admission.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
              kind: PodSecurityConfiguration
              exemptions:
                namespaces:
                  - openebs
      proxy:
        disabled: true
controlPlane:
  nodeLabels:
    openebs.io/engine: "mayastor"
  patches:
    - |-
      machine:
        sysctls:
          vm.nr_hugepages: "1024"
    - |-
      - op: add
        path: /machine/kubelet/extraMounts
        value:
          - destination: /var/openebs/local
            type: bind
            source: /var/openebs/local
            options:
              - bind
              - rshared
              - rw
```

It works, but it looks gross and you don't get any nice yaml
syntax highlighting in your editor.

What I learned you can do instead is make individual patch
yaml files (similar to what I was doing before switching to talhelper)
and then point to them. So instead of the above I had patch files like

```yaml
cluster:
  apiServer:
    admissionControl:
      - name: PodSecurity
        configuration:
          apiVersion: pod-security.admission.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
          kind: PodSecurityConfiguration
          exemptions:
            namespaces:
              - openebs
```

and 

```yaml
machine:
  sysctls:
    vm.nr_hugepages: "1024"
  nodeLabels:
    openebs.io/engine: "mayastor"
```

and

```yaml
machine:
  kubelet:
    extraMounts:
      - destination: /var/local
        type: bind
        source: /var/local
        options:
          - bind
          - rshared
          - rw
```

That I could then reference in `talconfig.yaml`:

```yaml
controlPlane:
  patches:
    - "@./patches/mayastor-cp.yaml"
    - "@./patches/mayastor.yaml"
    - "@./patches/var-local.yaml"
```

This cleans things up considerably, and also
makes it easier to keep track of what things are doing what.
For instance I can combine the hugepages config and nodelabel
configs into a mayastor patch that I know to apply on any
node that will be running a mayastor disk pool. I didn't
end up going with mayastor for storage but this idea will carry over.

# Combining helm apps with custom resources

For several of my apps I've wanted to install the
base app with helm, but then have also had to install
custom resources to go with them. Things like a
`ClusterSecretStore` to go along with external secrets.

The way I've done this to date is to make a custom
helm chart and list the parent app as a dependency.
This works, but it feels a bit heavy for specifying a
chart and then a couple extra resources. Instead I learned
that I can just give my argo app multiple `sources` and specify
my repo pointing to a resources folder as well as a helm
source along with the custom values for that chart. Again
using openebs as an example, it looks something like this:

```yaml
  sources:
    - repoURL: https://openebs.github.io/openebs
      targetRevision: 4.2.0
      chart: openebs
      helm:
        valuesObject:
          localpv-provisioner:
            localpv:
              basePath: "/var/local/openebs"
            hostpathClass:
              enabled: true
              name: openebs-hostpath
              isDefaultClass: false
              basePath: "/var/local/openebs"
          mayastor:
            etcd:
              localpvScConfig:
                basePath: "/var/local/openebs"
            loki-stack:
              localpvScConfig:
                basePath: "/var/local/openebs"
            io_engine:
              envcontext: "iova-mode=pa"
            csi:
              node:
                initContainers:
                  enabled: false
          engines:
            local:
              lvm:
                enabled: false
              zfs:
                enabled: false
    - repoURL: https://github.com/ianepreston/homelab.git
      path: k8s/dev/storage/openebs/resources
      targetRevision: HEAD
```

Not too shabby. I'm not going to bother converting my existing
apps to this pattern, but I'll keep it in mind for future ones for sure.
